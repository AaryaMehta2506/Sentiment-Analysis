5,29-Jul-18,Very easy setup.,1
5,17-Jul-18, ,1
5,26-Jul-18,"I purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because I found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren‚Äôt very wide to begin with. After going back and forth between this and the show I decided on this because I felt it had all the same features but is more compact. I can honestly say I have no regrets. While I probably wouldn‚Äôt watch a movie I‚Äôd been dying to see on this, it‚Äôs a great way to listen to music, watch a quick YouTube video, etc. I even attempted watching ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù on this and while it wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn‚Äôt as bad as one would think. I would definitely recommend!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Fun and  information.  No dislikes  so far !! Like the convenience!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,I am very pleased with the Fire Stick.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love these.  Great in the bathroom to listen to the news during showering.  Or listen to CNN live with Serius SM.,1
4,26-Jul-18,Speakers are not as loud as Google Home,1
5,30-Jul-18,Echo Dot and related devices are the best thing to come in a long time.,1
5,28-Jul-18,"Easy to use. Great for recipes, listen to music, see movies, movie trailers, so much to do....",1
2,30-Jul-18,las pel√≠culas no tiene o no se pueden cambiar a espa√±ol o t√≠tulos en espa√±ol,0
2,30-Jul-18,Thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality. Not much better than the Echo dot. Not worth the money.,0
4,03-Jun-18,Worked as advertised. Thanks,1
5,28-Jul-18,Easy set up and to use. I bought two one for my house and one for my 75 year old grandfather. I set it up for him a gave him a 15 minute lesson and he calls me at least once a day it‚Äôs is great to be able to see him in between visits.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Still love it,1
1,30-Jul-18,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.,0
4,28-Jul-18,"So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Great. Definitely gets a little old after a while but for $30 I can't really regret it at all. Love having it hooked up to my speakers via bluetooth and waking up to The Smiths.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Really like it,1
5,30-Jul-18,Finally bought one but it couldn't find my Wi-Fi. Had to buy a Wi-Fi extended. My smart t.v. used the Wi-Fi just fine.,1
5,28-Jul-18,"Love my Echo Show!! Now I can listen to music, get recipes, and so much more!!! I highly recommend the Echo for everyone!!",1
3,30-Jul-18,I don'r know how to use it yet.  Need more explicit directions for the electeonically challenged.  I did not get the feee lifht bulb that was part of the package.,1
5,28-Jul-18,Love it. It is in my kitchen so I can watch Prime Video while cooking.,1
3,30-Jul-18,Netflix and Hulu,1
5,30-Jul-18,Excellent. Bought another one yesterday!,1
5,29-Jul-18,We enjoy it,1
5,29-Jul-18,the best,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love it,1
5,30-Jul-18,wonderful product and fast delivery!,1
3,05-Jun-18,Not bad bad speaker for sound,1
5,30-Jul-18,We have only been using Alexa for a couple of days and are having a lot of fun with our new toy. It like having a new household member! We are trying to learn all the different featues and benefits that come with it.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Good Value,1
5,28-Jul-18,"We now have a dot, spot, echo and show and love the show and spot best. The show has great sound and my wife loves the display for weather, recipes and sing alongside. Super deal.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Awesome, wish I had gotten one sooner.",1
5,31-Jul-18,Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive,1
5,31-Jul-18,"Excellent to listen to my music, my audio books, and look all my cameras in and around my house.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Very good quality,1
5,20-Jul-18,I like the Echo Spot because it fits into my decor and I can also sing along with my favorite songs,1
5,30-Jul-18,It works great!!,1
4,30-Jul-18,"I love this fire stick because after installing a few highly recommended apps, I discovered that a lot of the channels I don't have with my cable provider is included,  and I don't have to pay extra! Just subscribing to a few streaming apps will do and I still come out paying way less than cable tv.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Used for personal use. We like hearing weather, news from CNN, and various playlists.",1
1,30-Jul-18,The product sounded the same as the emoji speaker from five below my sister has ... and even that one has Bluetooth and doesn‚Äôt need to be plugged in. The only good thing about this is that you can speak to it.,0
3,28-Jul-18,"I like the option for white, but it‚Äôs bizarre that it comes with a black cord. I have a white kitchen, so now I have this stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb black power cord. For aesthetic purposes, I was happier with my year-old white Echo (not Show) because it came with a white powercord. This seems like a major design flaw in the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù option. I strongly urge Amazon to change out the powercord to white.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Works great.Having fun playing music,checking weather,a king questions.",1
5,19-Jul-18,Love It,1
5,30-Jul-18,I like the hands free operation vs the Tap. We use both for controlling smart plugs.,1
5,29-Jun-18,We have a great time using this as a family. Even my toddler can talk to her . There are a few features I wish it would learn to do  but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the Google home !,1
5,30-Jul-18,So far I like it ü§ì,1
5,30-Jul-18,"This was an impulse buy but turns out I really enjoy my new dot. My grands love requesting songs and playing games. I like listening to my audible selection, keeping up with my to do lists and discovering new Alexa skills. Fun and practical, my echo dot has been a surprisingly welcome addition to my home.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it‚Äôs great that I was able to set that as default. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He‚Äôs a lot more calmer and doesn‚Äôt bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It‚Äôs a must have!",1
5,30-Jul-18,"awesome thing, love Alexa",1
4,13-Jul-18,"There's room for improvement on this. For the price, I cannot complain too much. I can still complain however, the audio is terrible. This is kind of like listening to a speak-n-spell from the 80s.",1
1,30-Jul-18,Echo Dot responds to us when we aren't even talking to it. I've unplugged it. It feels like it's &#34;spying&#34; on us.,0
5,30-Jul-18,fun so far. learning to use her.,1
4,28-Jul-18,"Big step up from the Dot! Dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up Ring Pro video, though looks great once the feed is displayed.",1
5,28-Jul-18,Love it!  We have other echoes and love those so I bought this on prime day!  No regrets.  Love that I can connect to my Ring and see the front door.  Yhe kids like seeing the lyrics to songs and sing along. .,1
2,20-Jul-18,"Why do we need to buy a $100 hub to get it to work with Samsung TV's and many other devices?  I want my money back!  This thing won't even turn on my TV unless I buy another hub.  What's the point of having a hub that doesn't support half the devices out there?  DON'T buy this thing unless you want to spend another $100 on another hub.  It won't work with many of your devices.  Just by the Echo or Dot if you must but not this.  Better yet, get a Google device.  They actually understand you when you talk.",0
5,30-Jul-18,Great buy. Recommend getting Kodi with some movie addons,1
1,30-Jul-18,Used twice not working!!!!!!!,0
5,29-Jul-18,I love it.  I made a group with my echo dot so I get music through my home.  I am waiting for the to go on sale again so hopefully I can get another spot for my bedroom..  I love the alarm and weather at the sound of my voice..,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Still getting used to Alexa, don't have her connected to our TV yet or other things right now use her for music and information, which she is great!!",1
5,30-Jul-18,I love this! It‚Äôs user friendly and better than any streaming device we have previously used. I wish we had purchased sooner and purchased more of them.,1
1,30-Jul-18,"Seems to work ok, but no youtube tv?  Really?  can't believe they would ban an app that so many people want to use.  I really wanted to like it, but when I couldn't install that particular app it became almost useless, almost.  Does most other stuff just fine, but I'll stick with my Roku.",0
5,29-Jul-18,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!,1
4,29-Jul-18,"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it.",1
4,30-Jul-18,I like it and still learning how to use it.,1
5,28-Jul-18,Love the speakers and the screen.,1
5,26-Jul-18,It was easy set up.  I use it more than I thought.,1
5,16-Jul-18,"Love my spot! My favorite feature is the &#34;Alexa, start my day.&#34; I love that I can hear the weather, traffic and even the word of the day! It even goes right into my favorite podcast while I get dressed!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Great,1
2,30-Jul-18, ,0
5,29-Jul-18,"I‚Äôm having trouble connecting my tv to it, but I‚Äôm not exactly tech smart. I‚Äôm sure one of my grandsons will figure it out for me. So far I‚Äôve been using it mostly for music.",1
5,11-Jul-18,Very easy to set up and use. Slowly adding devices to truly make our house a smart home. Both Alexa and I are learning what we can do.  With each new item I am happier that I made the purchase.  So far my only regret is I didn‚Äôt do it sooner.,1
5,30-Jul-18,So far I like it ü§ì,1
4,30-Jul-18,Easy to set up. Still trying to get it to connect to a light bulb smart plug. Grandkids think Alex is cool!,1
5,30-Jul-18,It is s great tool helping with information.,1
1,24-Jul-18,"Great product EXCEPT there is no possible way for it to act as a clock the displays the time PERMANENTLY.  When in 'Clock' mode, the screen rotates between the clock face and a 'Things to Try' screen.  I intended on buying several units for my house, but I do not need a screen in the house that is permanently trying to upset me.  Acting as clock should be a BASIC feature of the Echo Spot.  How could you get this wrong, Amazon??  #FAIL",0
5,30-Jul-18,Love that you can use your cell phone to call Echo or Dot. You can also use Echo and Dot as intercoms.,1
4,31-Jul-18,I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.,1
3,30-Jul-18,"The sound quality wasn‚Äôt great, but it was inexpensive",1
4,27-Jun-18,"I love my Alexa Dot. I play games with my son, ask how the weather Is and I love that she works with my Amazon Fire Tv.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Extremely easy to use! Switched away from directv and use it to stream T.V.,1
5,07-Jul-18,A great buy,1
4,29-Jul-18,The ase of participating with Echo,1
5,30-Jul-18,I have an echo but wanted a dot for my bedroom. It was even easier to set up than my original echo.,1
5,28-Jul-18,Home,1
5,30-Jul-18,The Echo Dot was everything that I expected and more.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love being able to listen to music easily. Still learning all the features available,1
5,28-Jul-18,"I haven't had it very long, but so far our whole family is enjoying asking Alexa questions!",1
4,29-Jul-18,Like it to do more,1
5,30-Jul-18,Easy to hook up.  Wish I knew all its capabilities,1
5,28-Jul-18,I love it!  I wanted it primarily for the kitchen.  In addition to other common services I wanted it to use ALLRecipes and Cook's Illustrated recipes,1
4,30-Jul-18, ,1
5,28-Jul-18,Bought this on Prime day,1
4,30-Jul-18,I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.,1
5,30-Jul-18,It does what it's suppose to do great product.,1
5,28-Jul-18,From such a small speaker it sounds great,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it l. I plan on getting an echo for the kitchen.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Bought this for my daughter when she turned 9.  She loves it!!  I especially like the calling feature since she doesn‚Äôt have a cell phone.  She loves playing music and dancing and with Amazon music she can play all her favorite songs ...... sometimes over and over and over again lol!,1
5,28-Jul-18,I have been waiting for the Echo Show to go on sale and it was worth the wait. It was easy to set up and start using,1
5,29-Jul-18,great sound,1
4,28-Jul-18,It is great. But it would be better there was a way to use headphones with it.,1
3,30-Jul-18,"The Echo Show is ok, however the constant suggestions about what to ask Alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it. Also, I thought I could have the weather for an area displayed continuously,  but I have to talk to Alexa, which I don't want to do in the middle of the night. Had I payed full price it would have been returned. There are other features that are nice, but I may never use them.",1
5,17-Jul-18,Great product and Prime Day price! Took a while to figure out how to connect to my wireless network and the other Echo devices in my home. This came with a Philips smart bulb. It's better than having a clapper! I found instructions online to 'wake to music & philips light'. Very easy to set it up with the instructions. You even have an option of what song you want to wake up to!,1
5,29-Jul-18,"I have the original Alexa and the Tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best. I'm happy to see they are making improvements with each new one.It would be great to have updates to our little A.I.'s, I think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it. All in all I am very happy with her and I can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble. Thank you",1
5,30-Jul-18,Love all the options with the fire tv stick!Works great!,1
5,28-Jul-18,Love the echo show. The video quality is good and of course sound is good too.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Needs to be smarter,1
5,29-Jul-18,Very nice!  I'm impressed - wish she had more to say though.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"Same specs as regular echo, but easier to use than getting a separate hub for smart lights, etc.",1
4,29-Jul-18,It's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything I ask but it's still nice to use.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting.",1
4,29-Jul-18,"Very cool product. Easy to setup, fun to use and sound quality is much better than I anticipated.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Love this just wish it had a built in hub,1
4,30-Jul-18,My son loves his Echo Dot.,1
5,31-Jul-18,"The echo dot was easy to set up and use. It helps provide music, etc. to small spaces and was just what I was looking for.",1
5,19-Jul-18,In one word: Amazing! Best tech purchase I have ever made as it controls all devices in my house and even my pool!,1
2,29-Jul-18,Too difficult to set up.  It keeps timing out before you can enter the password,0
5,09-Jul-18,Thanks,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love that is can do so much! It sits on my nightstand! Only improvements I would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger. But overall I‚Äôm happy I have it! Would recommend!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Works as you‚Äôd expect and then some. Also good sound quality considering price (70.00 on sale) and features.,1
5,26-Jul-18,Love it getting use to it and Alexa is getting use to my voice . Sometimes she doesn't answer but I think it has to do when internet is low or is updating or my voice isn't strong. Over all I haven't had any of the annoying stuff that everyone is complaining about. Thank goodness I didn't listen to those reviews.  And paid attention to the Apple guy .,1
5,30-Jul-18,The entire family loves Alexa Echo. She‚Äôs now a part of this family.,1
5,04-Jul-18,"Besides being fun, it also has many practical aspects--a real bonus for those with vision issues!",1
5,26-Jul-18,I love it the coolest thing since sliced bread,1
4,30-Jul-18,"It's not perfect, but I really like this little gizmo. i bought it primarily for 2 purposes. First, so I could set wake-up alarms by individual days, and set the wake-up music individually by the day. Second, I wanted to control a bedroom light by voice, so I could shut it off as I was falling asleep, without having to get out of bed to turn a switch. The Echo Spot, together with a smart plug,has been able to accomplish that. A bonus has been getting Alexa to play music from my Amazon Prime playlists.What's not so great is that sometimes Alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions, and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating. Hopefully the AI gets better in the future, along with added functions.",1
2,30-Jul-18,"Very disappointed when we had to mandatory upgrade and when we final got done with the upload, we had lost our local Charlotte NC channels (which are pur news and weather also)  (CBS, NBC, ABC) and 2 days later was Amazon day with discounts on what we had JUST ordered.",0
1,29-Jul-18,"Always wanted one,till I got one, it's not at all what it's cracked up to be, it's hard to navigate I actually like the dot better.",0
5,23-Jul-18,Love the Spot - Awesome little guy with precise video - I‚Äôm saving to buy one for my mom on the east coast - The Spot changes Everything as far as keeping your loved ones connected!!!Well worth every Cent!!,1
4,28-Jul-18,I wish it did more with internet searches.  I do like the feature it has,1
5,31-Jul-18,Streaming is easy.  I love it because I can watch Netflix in my bedroom on my TV and not my Ipad,1
1,30-Jul-18, ,0
5,30-Jul-18,Up dated news,1
5,30-Jul-18,Great sound in a small package‚Äîeasy to set up and use; fun to own.,1
5,27-May-18,I like that it knows my music type.The least is that it isn't wireless and the volume is not that high.,1
4,30-Jul-18,This is pretty cool,1
5,29-Jul-18,"I have had all good experience, so far with the second generation Echo. There are so many more things to learn, but I have not had the time yet. Right now, I am mostly enjoying the music, weather updates, using the alarm feature, and her personality. I have also purchased some mini smart socket yes. I am very excited to begin using them",1
1,30-Jul-18,I didn't like that almost everytime i asked Alexa a question she would say i dont know that or i havent learned that.,0
5,30-Jul-18,Great to have along with the Echo,1
5,30-Jul-18,So far so good.,1
3,28-Jul-18,I do like the product we bought it on Prime day but this week it was $30 cheaper then Prime day. Still a really cool device. I wish I would have waited.,1
3,30-Jul-18,"I like the Echo, but not sure about the Dot.  I use it a lot for music and Audio books.The sound quality of this smaller Echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model.  I haven't decided if I'll keep it or not!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Happy with Echo Plus. Having fun learning what I can do with it.,1
4,27-Jun-18,"Love it. Though, wish it was portable.",1
5,30-Jul-18,I already bought one previously to try out and enjoyed it.  Bought these new ones during the Prime sale.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Everything about it is great, love the Alexa voice remote",1
5,30-Jul-18,This device is awesome!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Amazing product. Still learnimg all the things it can do,1
5,30-Jul-18,Works well I have several of these recommend to anyone,1
5,29-Jul-18,"I replaced my 1st gen, was concerned about a smaller unit not having the same sound...I was wrong.  If anything it's the same volume, and more clear.  Good product.",1
4,30-Jul-18,"So far pretty happy with the Spot. For me it really is a glorified alarm clock/radio and I know I could have something more cost effective but eh, I like it. I had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did. So far so good.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it!,1
5,04-Jul-18,"Excellent product, mint condition for a refurbished unit - you would never know it's been refurbished!",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Easy set up, nice looking interface and I like the new slightly larger remote. I have a 1st Gen with the little remote and misplace it all the time. And great price!",1
4,30-Jul-18,"i liked the sound . what is troubling is that I paid extra money to have access to a million more songs. Sometimes it doesn't work. Ex. Alexa play Italian songs&#34; .don't have or don&#34; t understand. or play the opera Tosca, response &#34;sorry I don&#34;t have that.",1
5,02-Jul-18,"saving $10 is always nice and my son always says that buying refurbished means your are getting a new device or product for less, because it has been run through a diagnostics again and everything has been corrected.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Barry,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I had put this off for awhile but finally got around to buying 3 of them for my home. My wife is legally blind and cannot use the computer. This has been a Godsend, 100%. We have the Amazon music for her and now she can listen to music, check the weather, get phone numbers, make calls, etc., etc.. We are still learning but I tell you, this is absolutely amazing. I purchased 4 more for my extended family and the grandchildren absolutely love playing their music on Alexa. With the wifi and direct cable capability, the speaker/stereo options are there for the choosing. This is well worth the money. You won't regret this at all!",1
1,11-Jun-18,"Very bad this device, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because is refurbished or what but it activated by itself , nobody is talking and he just activated and start talking. When you talk you have to yell super lauded",0
5,29-Jul-18,easy to use.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"I bought this because it can control fios television. It works well. I‚Äôm hoping over time it will do more to control fios. Then I discovered all the other things Alexa can do. Play music you ask for. Great sound from Alexa. Play games. Play radio stations. Play old time radio programs like the Long Ranger. Alexa has many ‚Äúapps‚Äù you can add to her abilities. The other day I played Madlibs. Great fun. Also Alexa can control household appliances. I just purchased Alexa compatible power strips to control lighting, fans and TV components. I‚Äôm looking forward to implementing this controll. You can also add other Alexa components to have chosen music to play in all rooms where the components are located.",1
5,29-Jul-18,This is a great product!  Set up was easy.  Sound is wonderful.,1
3,03-Jun-18,"I received an Echo as a gift, loved it so much I decided to get the Dot for my bedroom. Both very easy to set up but a big difference in the sound quality. I would still buy it again.",1
1,30-Jul-18,I am having real difficulty working with the Echo Dot. Alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions I have asked I get the &#34;I'm not sure&#34;  Half the time I am still asking the question and Alexi is saying &#34;I'm not sure&#34;. The music is great and works well for that. All in All so far it's been a very frustrating experience.,0
5,30-Jul-18,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Already had an Echo Dot. The Echo is even better with fuller sound. Also during setup it now lets phone calls to be made to my contact list which is great!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Very satisfied with the Echo. Alexa now controls the lights in my family room and my wife can listen to Jimmy Buffet by just asking Alexa.,1
5,30-Jul-18,The ease in installing,1
5,28-Jul-18,"I‚Äôm still learning how to use the Echo, but so far I love it!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Awesome product!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Upgraded from echo to echo show.,1
2,15-Jun-18,The echo dot disconnects from the speaker about 12-20 times a day. Do not buy the refurbished product.  2 stars for effort.,0
5,29-Jul-18,more compact and a bit better than the original,1
5,30-Jul-18,awesome.understands my kids,1
5,24-Jul-18,"Great product, easy to install and use! Not a necessity but a commodity!",1
5,21-Jul-18,"I got this on Prime day and figured I'd see what all the hype is about.  Honestly I didn't really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird, but honestly, I love it.  Like it or not this is the way the world is going, so why not.I loved it so much I ordered 2.  I didn't get the Show because it looks like it came from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  I have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the Spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.Alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  My favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where I can just say play any song I want and it will.  I guess I could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.The one thing that I am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  I'd love for it to display the weather as I listen to music.The screen is clear and I also really enjoy Alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  I have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  So it really works great.The one thing that I actually preferred the Dot over the Spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. I have not seen the Spot really do much for package notifications yet.  The dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  I would recommend Amazon do exactly what they did for the Dot but on the Spot - the Dot lights up colors - why can't the Spot ?  The same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.Overall it's a great device that I am looking forward to integrating my home around.  I'm already looking at dash buttons, smart plugs, etc..- and = when I become a home owner instead of renting where I can't tinker with my thermostat I will be purchasing a Nest down the road for HVAC integration.",1
5,29-Jul-18,Great,1
5,30-Jul-18,Does everything I need!,1
5,31-Jul-18,Love my Echo!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Love it very much, still learning everything that my Echo can do, but am really enjoying the whole process.",1
1,31-May-18,"If you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the Echo/Dot units simultaneously, YOU MUST PAY A MONTHLY FEE. I thought this was Amazon, not Apple??!! I‚Äôve paid for many of these so I could have one in each room, is that not enough of my money??!!??",0
5,16-Jul-18,Looks and works perfect. Glad I got a good deal.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Absolutely love it!!!!,1
5,25-Jul-18,"How can you not like the Echo Plus.  It has the built in Hub and works seamlessly with all my compatible devices.  Amazon makes a great product and I haven't had a single issue with this one or any of the other devices (echo dots, etc.).",1
4,30-Jul-18,"I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa",1
1,29-Jul-18,"I bought this product hoping that Alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along, therefore expecting her to be responsive. This $100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her. (Echo buttons manual, see Step 3.) The device has potential given it has a big screen, decent sound but for 200 bucks, I would never reccomend it. Even for the $100 I spent, I feel like I got shorted. Oh and lastly, the device is pretty useless without a prime membership. I linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker. I went on the family account (this one) and got it to work minimal. Oh, and even with our prime membership, you have to have a music pass or something that's an extra 3.99 a month, leaving this item a subscription nightmare, and a overpriced, decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes. I would give it zero stars if I could.",0
5,19-Jul-18,Love it,1
5,29-Jul-18,I really love my amazon echo. I think the sound quality is great and we have a lot of fun with it. It is really handy for music and to get updates on the weather and sports!,1
4,28-Jul-18,I enjoy the various functions of the device,1
5,30-Jul-18,"She works well. Needs a learning command  for unique, owners and users like. Alexa ‚Äúlearn‚Äù Tasha‚Äôs birthday.  Or Alexa ‚Äúlearn‚Äù my definition of Fine. Etc. other than that she is great",1
5,29-Jul-18,The best part of this product is you can control the thermostat and lights for your house.  There isn‚Äôt anything I dislike.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Great price.  I love my echo dot,",1
5,30-Jul-18,Just what I expected....,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it and Alexa. I am not very savvy but support was very helpful and patient.,1
5,26-Jul-18,"Great product, what they don't tell you is that once you allow a &#34;Drop In&#34;  they can drop in anytime!!!  While they are sleeping, while we are yelling at them, while anything.",1
5,15-Jul-18,I had just said to myself how I desired an assistant when I came across the Spot!  As a Mom of two things can get hectic really quickly trying to manage everyone‚Äôs schedules & my own. I just verbally tell Alexa what reminder or timer I need set and Voila!Having my Spot has given me the virtual assistant I so desired without having to actually hire someone.  Not to mention the many other awesome features. I have Alexa synced with my Audible & Kindle & Alex can read a book from my libraries to me.I‚Äôm still excited to see what else my Spot can do!Side note: I had wanted to purchase a Show for a while & probably still will down the line however I sooooo love my sleek little Sopt!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it! Very helpful,1
4,30-Jul-18,"Love it but the volume could definitely use a boost. If it had better built in speaker's, would definitively be a 5 star. They thought ahead and put  an audio auxiliary input, so I bought a dedicated speaker for the Echo. Proved to be best way to go.",1
5,30-Jul-18,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.,1
4,29-Jul-18,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.",1
5,18-Jul-18,"The sound quality is great, it now replace the echo dot in my kitchen.",1
1,06-Jun-18,I cant figure out how to use it.,0
5,29-Jul-18,"My mom bought a few Echo Dots and repeated ask me to take one of hers because it was so great. I told her ‚Äúno‚Äù for two days. When she made me take it, 6 hours later I could not live my life without it!  It‚Äôs that amazing, so now we have four large speakers and only the small Echo Dot, that I will be returning to her. I say if you‚Äôre going to order an Alexa speaker, go big and get the Echo, otherwise tou‚Äôll Be returning the two Echo Dots you couldn‚Äôt live without.",1
5,10-Jun-18,"Works great, can't tell it was refurbished and set up in kids mode.  I have 3 in my home and will be adding more. I love these things.",1

5,28-Jul-18,Love these!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I don't have Alexa, but after getting this I'm feeling inspired to get one. I feel this is a good gateway and or Alexa trial, and liking it so far.  Channels work just fine like Apple TV, just need to check if there is a phone app for a keyboard typing, because spelling things out on keyboard sucks for searching YouTube clips",1

Amazon customer service couldn't help further and told me warranty was only 3 months, which was very disappointing, so they weren't willing to replace.",0
5,30-Jul-18,Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.,1

4,30-Jul-18,New device so still learning about it but works great for us when navigating Hulu.,1
3,29-Jul-18,I don't think the &#34;2nd gen&#34; sounds as good as the 1st.  But it does have an aux out... so you could add an external speaker.  But if you are going to do that why wouldn't you just get a dot?  2nd issue is (which isn't unique to this unit but I don't understand why I can't override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a &#34;group&#34;.  I get there is a delay when using a BT speaker.  But if the other units are not where they can be heard then I should be able to play as a group while using the BT speaker.,1

5,30-Jul-18,Oh I love my Echo Show and the video news spots,1
5,30-Jul-18,Still learning all the ways to use it.  It is a real hit with my grandkids who ask it to play music and then dance to it.  (5 and 7 yrs).  Very cute.,1
5,25-Jul-18,I love it and my family loves it also we use it all the time we also like playing the games that you can get on it too!! Great for family game nights,1

5,31-Jul-18,Family loved it!,1
5,11-Jun-18,I bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs. But I have no need for it. I only used it once. The volume was not loud enough for me when I played music while I was on my treadmill. So I rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder.,1
5,30-Jun-18,amazing product with amazing sound!,1

Would be nice if it could interact with my Xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my Xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras, be nice set and disarm the alarm with Alexa. Had to install a skill app to setup bulb ??? whats that about, you ship it with your product ??? should have said (Alexa setup bulb) or (Alexa find new bulb) ??? and (Alexa setup Nest)??? it's fine that you use third party apps but Alexa should do the work for you.",0

2,29-Jul-18,"It's like having another kid in the house; I have to constantly repeat myself.I can tell Alexa to do something clear as day, and according to the history, she hears something comeletely different.The device is really cool, and I like the concept, which is why it gets two stars. However, it just doesn't work as intended.I find myself irritated more often than not when I use this device.",0
5,18-Jul-18,Just got mine last night. Played around with it for a while. Should have bought it a long time ago.,1
5,31-Jul-18,Small device that my kids like to ask questions. Very handy friendly interactive,1
5,29-Jul-18,"This was given to my 7 year at the time as a birthday gift from his dad. He loves it, ask Alexa anything she has the answer, plus it‚Äôs good for homework. So I purchased one on prime day for my bathroom for when I‚Äôm getting ready for work. I listen to music at 4am and the base it‚Äôs metro booming.. Replacement for my clock radio, plus I have the echo dot on my night stand as my alarm clock..",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Works beautifully, excellent sound.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Very easy to set up. Works wonderful and I love it!!,1
5,09-Jul-18,Works great!,1
5,30-Jul-18,I was a little nervous when I received my new Echo as I'm not really Tech savvy. I found it a bit intimidating at first but it didn't take me to long to figure it out!! I'm very happy with my purchase and now thinking of adding an echo spot!!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Works really well.,1
5,28-Jul-18,Great device,1
5,30-Jun-18,"I love the Echo Plus mainly because I don't have to worry about putting a CD, in to play. I just command a song and it plays. However; I was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the Echo. After consulting with Amazon and learning that I can purchase a portable Echo charging station I'm good.Sincerely,",1
5,13-Jul-18,"It's an echo, and it works.  For the price it's great deal. Have had no issues with it.  As with all dots, the speaker is a bit tinny, but good for a second unit, or if you are like me, you can attach it to an external speaker for more sound.Good buy",1
4,30-Jul-18,It's alright....,1
5,25-Jun-18,"I love Alexa! It's great helping me, making my appointments, playing the songs I like! What else can you do? Looking forward for more.",1
4,29-Jul-18,"It‚Äôs my second one, so I put this one in the kitchen for recipes.",1
5,29-Jul-18,Listen music and set timer,1
3,30-Jul-18,"I bought this for my healing room.  I play continuous spa like music. Although Alexa knows the type of music needed, the device does not deliver quality sound it sounds muffled.  I didn't know I had to buy speakers too.",1
3,27-Jul-18,Has weird pauses in her speech pattern that are not present in my other echo devices.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love having one in our bedroom and in the kitchen. Great to drop in on family around the house.,1
5,28-Jul-18,"An outstanding piece of Technology, I use it everyday for information, scheduling and general information.  Awesome Amazon, keep improving with AI.",1
4,26-Jul-18,"Connecting and sound are perfect! I only give 4 because the is no internal battery, if I disconnect to the power source, it will be off.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Not that much different than the one we had.  Alexa is still stubborn. LOL.  We ordered it on the Prime day to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs.  When we called she said they were sold out.  Felt bad about that.  Now we have to buy light bulbs.,1
3,26-Jul-18,"Mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time, it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result.",1
5,29-Jul-18,"So far, I like it.  It is better than I expecting it.",1
1,30-Jul-18,"It still doesn‚Äôt work.  I bet if I call and let them know that, they will charge me for the 3rd time.  Ridiculous.",0
5,30-Jul-18,Cool,1
5,26-Jul-18,Great buy!,1
5,28-Jul-18,My first smart buy..I am loving it and all the great things Alexa can do.,1
1,30-Jul-18,Not much features.,0
5,28-Jul-18,love the spot,1
1,28-Jul-18,The tech isn‚Äôt there. It doesn‚Äôt understand most common words and is basically a glorified radio,0
5,30-Jul-18,"Excellent quality, very good sound, great deal on Prime Day.",1
3,26-Jul-18,Doesn't seem to hear as well as my 2nd Generation Echo and WHY is there no volume buttons on it?!,1
5,26-Jul-18,Worked great. The built in hub works great.,1
4,19-Jun-18,"Works very well, but the microphone don&#34;t pick up as well as the full size echo.  Audio quality is okay for the size.",1

5,26-May-18, ,1
5,30-Jul-18,Currently own 3 Chromecast devices and tge Fire Stick is superior to them.  We are so pleased that we can watch programs on Netflix and Prime without a smart phone or computer.  Very easy to install and use!,1
5,14-Jul-18,everything perfect,1
2,29-Jul-18,It's got great sound and bass but it doesn't work all of the time. Its still hot or miss when it recognizes things,0
5,30-Jul-18,Entertainment,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Awesome life changer! Seriously, I am able to start my morning with Alexa, by having her &#34;wake&#34;me up with  her alarm and then playing me some music. She has gotten used to my voice, that I can be in another room and she will &#34;listen&#34; to what I say. I love both my echos!!! Don't hesitate, get one and for the price, the speaker is unbelievable. I am buying the cordless holder, so I can take the echo anywhere. Love my purchase and love alexa!!!!",1
3,30-Jul-18,"Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Like having the music where ever I am.,1
5,29-Jul-18,The speakers on these devices are surprisingly good. The functionality of each echo device is fantastic.,1
5,29-Jul-18,I use it in my office and another at my apartment for music and information,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Love the Firestick! My kids love that they can talk to Alexa and get the weather, local news, etc.",1
5,27-Jun-18,of course!,1
3,29-Jul-18, ,1
5,16-May-18,Like new.  No difference from new unused original.,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Perfect! May favorite Alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well.  We changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. Good job Amazon!",1
5,22-May-18,"I love this, answers all my stupid questions and tells me the weather for when I don‚Äôt get off the couch",1
2,05-Jun-18,It doesn‚Äôt always  work,0
5,30-Jul-18,"Works great, speed is fast. Exactly what we needed",1
4,30-Jul-18,I like having more Alexa devices in my house and the sales price on amazon prime day was too tempting.,1
5,30-Jul-18,I use it primarily to play music.  It works wonderfully!  Still getting used to some of the many things it will do.  Amazon has sent several tips since I got it. Thanks for all your help!,1
3,30-Jul-18,its okay but keeps dropping wifi!,1
4,18-May-18,"Not very loud but quality and ease of use is great. Sound is perfect for background music, would suggest 2-or more connected together if you‚Äôre trying to use for hosting a louder party",1
5,26-Jun-18,I like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart TV if I ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if I ask you to change the channel it does or doesn't sometimes I have to reset it I don't know if it's because it's refurbished but it's okay it's just not what I expected,1
5,29-Jul-18,Love being able to read the lyrics of my favorite songs.,1
5,22-Jul-18,"I wasn't sure I really wanted one of these, but now that I have it, it is extremely useful.  Get one, you'll love it!",1
5,29-Jul-18, ,1
5,18-Jul-18,very nice! everything is working fine. just have to 100% learn the commands,1
5,30-Jul-18, ,1
1,30-Jul-18,"Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?",0
5,27-Jul-18,This is the one of my favorite Amazon devices.  Have one in my bedroom and use as alarm clock. Perfect addition to our home of Alexa devices.,1
5,26-Jul-18,"Works great! Exactly as described. Only complaint I have is sometimes Alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around, but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff.",1
5,28-Jul-18,Alexa is easy to operate and set up.  Have had it for about 10 days now and love it.,1
4,09-Jul-18,"The price is great.  Was having trouble with it hearing me from across a room, but after moving it to another spot, it seems to be working fine.  Will buy some more. Want 1 in every room.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"I have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole. Completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock. It is the perfect bedside counter device - alarm, wake up music, weather, top news stories, etc. Perfect device for what I wanted and does so much more than I expected it to do, calling feature is also a huge selling point. This is a must own item. Probably will grab more Echos in the future.",1
5,07-Jul-18,Love,1
4,28-Jul-18,I never had ALEXA before but the biggest reason I bought it was for YOUTUBE and apparently YOUTUBE stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars.... it's mostly YOUTUBE's FAULT but I worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist,1
1,27-Jul-18,You need a Harvard law degree to operate this thing! It's going back very soon!,0
5,17-Jul-18,"So easy to use, non-stop music!",1
1,28-Jul-18,Alexa hardly came on..,0
5,30-Jul-18,I love it.  It is so easy to use,1
5,28-Jul-18,Love seeing everything in the display!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Still learning all the capabilities...but so far pretty pretty pretty good,1
5,19-Jul-18,Good product.,1
5,31-Jul-18,I LOVE my Firestick.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Works great!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Works great no lag and is much better than the gen 1 devices I was using. I would recommend this if you have a 1rst gen and are tired of the lag and crashes.,1
5,30-Jul-18,BEST father's day gift. Dad joked to my mom that Alexa will be the one listening to all of his (repeated) stories going forward.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Love it. The only downside is that you can't download any app you want.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Very easy to set up and have no issues.,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Once set up very user friendly. Set-up wasn't as user friendly as I'd hoped.. The alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing [invasive ] drivers. My wife and I are both retired and she wouldn't have been able to install Alexa, but if my son wasn't supplying her with a smart phone we wouldn't be using Alexa yet.",1
2,23-Jul-18,"All is fine with the Spot exact for one massive failing.  In order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  YES, you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i) swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.This is especially annoying as Amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but NOT delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  But as the clock has been out for a year now and they still haven't adding this setting, clearly not going to happen.  This may be the biggest product design screw up Amazon has ever made.",0
5,23-Jun-18,No problems,1
5,29-Jul-18,Works great! Perfect for my office!,1
4,30-Jul-18,"As Always, easy to set up",1

2,23-Jul-18,"I'm sure the Echo is as cool as everyone says....but I won't get to try this one. Even though I have a Large covered porch.....the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100% chance of rain.....and rain it did, soaking the package. I'm not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is. This order has been cursed from the beginning. Ordered as a Birthday Gift and Delivery was not made on scheduled day. Now I get it, and its rain-soaked.",0
5,30-Jul-18,It's Alexa.... what else can you say,1
5,27-Jul-18,"Great product, and i like the screen for a alarm clock",1
5,30-Jul-18,I love it! I use it for everything. It‚Äôs a part of my daily routine,1
5,31-Jul-18,"I received the echo as a gift. I needed another Bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible, and found this smart speaker. Can‚Äôt wait to see what else it can do.",1
5,12-Jun-18,Love the Echo Dot. Helps husband get Netflix and other apps on our Amazon Fire TV.  No problems with it being refurbished. Planning on getting another one for the Amazon Fire Stick in bedroom.,1
4,27-Jul-18,Sound is better,1
5,30-Jul-18,"My new best friend!! I'm a little behind the times I've never had anything like this, another alexa or google home, so to me this is a super amazing useful tool. I use it to play sleep sounds to sleep. I use it for my amazon audible books. Set alarms, reminders, receive notifications, play games with her. Have her tell me a short story lol. It's pretty fun. I know some people complained about the speaker I'm not sure why. I'm sure if you have an open concept house all to yourself and want to blast music no this might not blast it around loud enough. But I rent a room and in my bedroom it's perfect I don't have any problems with the speaker. Love everything about it!",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Upgraded from an original Echo on Prime Day and so far I love it. I'm sure I have a long way to go to maximize its utility,  but for now I owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing. Who knew Post Malone actually used words?!",1
4,30-Jul-18,Setting up,1
2,30-Jul-18,Sound is terrible. Cannot pair with echo to play simultaneously.  Must upgrade to amazon music if you want to play more than one device at a time.,0
5,30-Jul-18,I love you so much,1
4,05-Jun-18,"This is a great device. We mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list, but occasionally use any number of the &#34;fun&#34; things you can program it to do, like go to Red Alert or make the TARDIS land (yes, we're a house of geeks... we even chose the wake-word to be &#34;Computer&#34; instead of &#34;Alexa&#34;. Now we just need Majel Barret's voice and I will be in geek heaven.) ;)It's not as easy to get my Premium Spotify to work properly with it, and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms, but so far it's still been worth it. I am often asking it the time, the weather, it even gives us a news briefing. We also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome. Plus it's fun knowing the NSA is listening to everything.",1
5,19-May-18,It has all I need for my life plans time date music,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I purchased echo about 2 weeks ago , I love this product, I would definitely recommend",1
4,27-Jul-18,We have used for last 2 weeks. We like it. My children also like it. Alexa has become part of our family.,1

5,20-May-18,Works great!,1
5,28-Jul-18,Super easy set up! Great features! FUN!,1

4,30-Jul-18,"4.5 out of 5 Stars. I generally like this product. Its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music, setting timers, and making calls. Reason why I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my Echo stops playing music and shows a red ring. Seems to be a connection issue. Overall, great product.",1

After doing research online I saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. However, the same weekend I took a trip and brought my Echo Dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine. Now back home, the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it's little rough patch and I haven't had any problems since. So, if you are having connection issues with an Echo Dot then it is probably the internet and not the device.",1
4,30-Jul-18,"I love this, it's quick and easy to use. I love that there are so many apps you can access but disappointed some of them cost extra money to use. I also love the music app on here. I didn't think I would use it because I have Alexa echo and listen to music all the time on there. But I tried it on the fire tv and it gives you the lyric as the songs play! Love it!!",1
5,29-Jul-18,"In a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house. Extrimelly useful hub of information, music, automation, communication, and assistant in basic needs. Would love to have a voice personalization. Some things are better not to said aloud but typed (like door unlocking codes) but that is problem of unwitty developers. So far only positive experience. The privacy invasions is happened way before Alexa, it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier. To Alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off.",1

I was really disappointed in the audio quality so I connected an external speaker via bluetooth. The audio was much better but I started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi, presumably due to interference from the bluetooth. Then  I connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack. when i did that, the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and I was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound. im hoping Amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which I hope will be a better nightstand device.",0
5,30-Jul-18,Love it...so happy to have everything available through this,1
3,30-Jul-18,it's annoying that everything they show Alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded. You spend so  much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself,1
5,30-Jul-18,It good,1
5,28-Jul-18,Perfect for controlling my tp-link smart devises,1

4,30-Jul-18,I'm amazed with the alarm. I tell Alexa to wake me up to a particular song and it does.  I love the play list if music. Not sure if i don't keep prime if music will still be available. However i did love the fact Amazon gave me music free for 3 months...they should have given prime free for 3 months as well.,1

4,30-Jul-18,We got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired ! it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once I did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff ! it should do Text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others !the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the Web by voice so he wouldn't feel left out and isolated ! they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the Echo so tech support can help setup the device ! I had to get a friend whos an IT guy to come help me setup,1
5,30-Jul-18,"My 90 year old Mom LOVES that she can watch the 1st Season of Blue Bloods ‚ù§. My one wish is that she could watch CSI:MIAMI...without having to pay for it...üò• The bill for OPTIMUM is already, quite high. Can you help us? We live on Long Island, NY (Suffolk County )",1
4,31-Jul-18,One problem you need to buy an app from amazon to mirroring your iphone .. app price 2.99$ .. other than that the device is perfect,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love the Alexa remote and easy to use.,1
4,01-Jul-18,goes great with our echo,1
1,27-Jul-18,no habla espanol,0
5,29-Jul-18,Purchased this for myself and am just beginning to learn all that it can do.  So far am very pleased and amazed at the different actions it can perform.  Am enjoying it and looking forward to learning more about other options it provides.,1
5,18-Jun-18,Works great as a BT receiver with output connected to vintage stereo equipment.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Great product,1
5,14-Jun-18,"I love this as a second &#34;Alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  Great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - Perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops multiple times each day and keep his eyes closed for 5 minutes.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Set up is so easy.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Ease of usage,1
3,30-Jul-18,"Hard to hear, had to blue tooth it to a better speaker.",1
5,17-May-18,Great price to extend the range and super value to dot offers. Hooked up wireless speaker to use working outside.This dot made outdoor sound range possible without disturbing indoor light control possible,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I love my Echo!  Works just like they said it would. I don't have a &#34;smart&#34; home, so I cannot speak about that function, but everything else about it is good.",1
3,30-Jul-18, ,1
3,28-Jul-18,"Was working great √∫til 1 week algo, √≠ have it for a month, but it started flickering,  and in the support forums they say it is a known isue,  but it has more the 4 months reported and There is no soluci√≥n.",1
5,08-Jul-18,Have now used for several months without problem.,1
5,31-Jul-18,Able to watch all of the shows I love and more.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"We love this thing! I wish I would have gotten it sooner. You will certainly want to go through the settings and lock it down if you have kids, but it is a great additional for even unexpected things like helping the kids with homework. There are loads of skills. I am very happy with this purchase, especially since I got it on prime day for almost half price.",1
5,29-Jul-18,Alexa is amazing! Great speaker.,1
2,26-Jul-18,"Honestly it's no different from the Echo dots I already own,  other then occasionally seeing the lyrics to a song I'm listening too i really don't see the difference.",0
5,11-Jun-18,Worked like new.  Will do it again.,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Love it, still learning, makes a lot of things easier, like if you forget to turn a light off and your in another room all you do is ask Alexa to turn the light off.",1
2,29-Jul-18,"I am not super impressed with Alexa. When my Prime lapsed, she wouldn't play anything. She isn't smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can't use it for that either. She randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her. Just today I unplugged her...not sure I'll ever use my Alexa again.",0
5,30-Jul-18,Great product,1
5,30-Jul-18,"This is my first digital assistant so I'm giving this a good review. Speaker is really good for the cheap price on Prime day. Fun to play with and can be used as an alarm clock (That's what I was going to get in the first place, but I ended up with Echo). If you haven't had a go with one then definitely try it!What I like best is the number of other devices that it can connect with. My purchase came with a Smart Plug for $10 which I connect my lamp to. Alexa, turn of the lights!",1
5,17-Jul-18,"I‚Äôve had this for a little over 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! It‚Äôs so easy to use. I‚Äôm basically using it as a smart alarm but it can do way more. The screen quality is great and it looks super cute sitting on my night stand. I don‚Äôt know how I lived without it so long. If you can‚Äôt decide whether to buy it or not, GO FOR IT! You won‚Äôt regret it!!",1
2,30-Jul-18,Sound is terrible if u want good music too get a bose,0
5,19-Jul-18,"I highly recommend the spot! I have it connected to the kasa camera and it is so convenient to just ask spot to, &#34;show me the camera&#34; when someone is at the door. Love it! As soon as amazon has a good sale on these again I will be getting another one! Good job Amazon!",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Love my Echo Show. Alexa is amazing and now on the Show &#34;she&#34; can display lyrics, photos, etc. The speakers are amazing and fills the room. Bought on Prime Day so got a great deal, so worth it.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Amazing so far. Just got it the other day.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I loved how easy this was to install sry up, and use! Simply amazing.  So amazing we bought two!This allowed us to officially ""CUT THE CABLE CORD"".Love it!",1
5,15-Jul-18,We love it! Bought the light bulbs as well and we use it daily!,1
5,30-Jun-18,Love it even though I‚Äôm still trying to figure out all the other things I can do with this item it works great with my phone.,1
5,18-Jul-18,This is a gift.  But I have one and love it.  The words to songs are great and the I live the face I chose for the clock.  This is my favorite echo (unless I am listening to music).,1
5,29-Jul-18,Super fun !! I ty is what I was expecting,1
5,28-Jul-18,Exactly as advertised,1
5,30-Jul-18,Great speaker i n this! I love this so much more than my alexa tap! It‚Äôs definitely fast in response and just so much prettier,1
5,18-Jul-18,"I absolutely love this! Very user friendly and I got the Kasa Cam to go with it to monitor my living room. Super easy to set up and operate. I only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately. I‚Äôm looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces. I like digital but I miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them. I‚Äôd also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices. I really have no complaints, I‚Äôm being nit picky at this point. Worth every penny!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Great product. Very versatile and easy to use,1
1,19-Jul-18,Get rid of the &#34;Thongs To Try&#34; screen!!!!!!!!!! Numb nuts!!!!!,0
5,30-Jul-18,"I'm still learning how to use it, but so far my Echo is great! The sound is actually much better than I was expecting.",1
5,21-Jul-18,Love it just wish I could play my amazon music on both my devices without having to buy an additional subscription,1
5,22-Jul-18,Awesome cute and smart!,1
1,29-Jul-18,This thing barely works. You have to select 3rd party apps to do stuff you'd think it could do out of the box. I'm sending mine back asap. Waste of money.,0
5,30-Jul-18,I am thoroughly enjoying my Ecoo!  Love to have it read my audiobook to me while in the office and then I can simply open the audiobook on my kindle to continue it when elsewhere. Wonderful for listening to music when not in the mood for a book. Great for setting reminders for myself too and so much more.,1
5,29-Jul-18,This is my fourth Echo (original and two dots). It's the best.... Decent speaker... Fun graphics...,1
5,30-Jul-18,Works great. Easy set up.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"It performs pretty much as expected, but I am very disappointed it will not provide me with the terminology I need to play various kinds of music without subscribing to the Amazon music service.  I understand my music choices may be limited, but without knowing HOW TO ASK, I cannot access the music that is provided free along with my Echo purchase.  Do you have a chart showing the language I need to use?",1
5,30-Jul-18,"I love this thing! The Alexa feature makes it so easy to find what you want no matter which streaming service has it.  No more searching Netflix then Amazon etc to see if either has your show,  Alexa finds it for you!",1
5,28-Jul-18,I‚Äôm never disappointed with amazons technology.,1
5,28-Jul-18,Is great having a new friend,1
5,30-Jul-18,Just like the other one,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love this its super convenient and makes my life a little easier,1
4,30-Jul-18,"Have only had it set up for a few days. Still adding smart home devices to it. The speaker is great for playing music. I like the size, we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it‚Äôs not intrusive to look at.",1
4,30-Jul-18,"I love having Alexa around the house. My favorite features are her timers, alarms, and music. Especially her library of sleep sounds. I got this product as a gift for my kids, and they love her too. She is great for reading time, and timing 30 minutes for it.The only thing I really don't like, is that she HAS to be plugged in to an outlet to function. No ifs ands, or buts. I get why, but it is minorly inconvenient, as I have to move her from room to room, or purchase more. Lol",1
5,29-Jul-18,Setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock,1
5,28-Jul-18,"I love my new echo.  It gives me hours of music and help with other things.It was difficult for me to set it up,  I had to have help from a Tekkie",1
1,12-Jul-18,Item has never worked. Out of box it is broken. Spent several days trying to get it working and running same &#34;fixes&#34; from Amazon. The only thing accomplished is I will never order another refurbished device.,0
3,30-Jul-18,It does not pick up my voice unless I yell most times.,1
5,02-Jul-18,Love it!  Great fun!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Tried to play certain broadway shows like Camelot and it gives ne the group Camelot.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Fun to use, good sound quality",1
5,29-Jul-18,I like everything about it !!!,1
5,29-Jul-18,Fun tech toy,1
5,30-Jul-18,"It was an excellent purchase. Echo Plus has sound quality, good size, I love it... I it!",1
5,29-Jul-18,great sound,1
5,29-Jul-18,Nice product A+,1
5,17-May-18,Works perfect! There‚Äôs no difference at all between this refurb one and my new ones that I have in my house. I‚Äôll be buying the refurbs from here on out,1
4,26-Jul-18,"It seems easy to stump Alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer.  We admit that we have not explored all that's available through the Echo.  One irritating issue is that Alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system, rather it refers you to the Alexa app or help via a computer.  It was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful.",1
2,30-Jul-18,"For the price, the product is nice quality and has a few nice features. So definitely no complaints there. The reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what I thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error. First, I didn‚Äôt know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work. So I really don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs not a stand alone device. Also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a Bluetooth speaker, don‚Äôt. Lastly, I‚Äôm sure the echo dot can do a lot but I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own, plus setting it up was awful. I would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù.",0
5,30-Jul-18,It's easy to set up and use. There are new features and skills added all the time.,1
4,31-Jul-18,Works as expected,1
5,18-Jun-18,I bought two refurbished ones for work and home. They both work perfectly and appear brand new,1
5,28-Jul-18,Its very nice,1
3,30-Jul-18,Speaker could be better qualty,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Love it! I was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered, I could not pass it up! It's fun to ask Alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from Amazon Prime Music. You can also connect your iPhone with bluetooth and play music with Pandora or YouTube videos using Alexa as a speaker. I've been having fun asking Alexa different types of questions or for information like weather, news or even the time in other countries. The only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan, because Alexa uses burns it up when playing music.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Love my echo. Love playing music in my room,1
1,30-Jul-18,The volume is very low,0
5,30-Jul-18,Love the Firestick thinking about canceling the satellite,1
4,30-Jul-18,Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability,1
5,30-Jul-18,Great sound in a small package‚Äîeasy to set up and use; fun to own.,1
5,28-Jul-18,From such a small speaker it sounds great,1
5,30-Jul-18,"We like it all so far, but have a lot to try out yet.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"I am really enjoying the many different features on my Alexa, especially listening to music and audio books",1
5,29-Jul-18,It's great sound and video quality,1
5,30-Jul-18,Just the perfect cost effective solution.  Thank you Amazon.,1
5,30-Jul-18,I purchased the Fire Stick to be able to watch movies at my convenience. I love that there is such a variety of genres. I also enjoy it gives you the ability to watch TV shows too. It's Awesome!,1
2,30-Jul-18,"I‚Äôm very unhappy with this Firestick, every time we change programs or channels within a program there is a very long delay. We have 2 Roku‚Äôs That work just fine and are very quick.",0
4,30-Jul-18,"Handy if you don't expect much out of it much ""dumber"" than the assistant in my phone.",1
4,29-Jul-18,"Good quality, great sound quality",1
5,16-Jun-18,This is just like new -- same performance as our brand new one; no problems.,1
2,30-Jul-18,No you tube wouldn't have bought it if I known that,0
5,30-Jul-18,Use it all the time and love it. Very quality product.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I sent it to my 85 year old Dad, and he talks to it constantly.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Echo Dot is a wonderful invention. We love it. Alexa is so smart.,1
5,29-Jul-18,"I have had pure fun with my echo.  Weather, jokes, news briefing, and music but still so much more to use it for.  A lot of fun for the money.",1
5,29-Jul-18,great sound easy set up looks cool,1
5,30-Jul-18,It works great!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of.",1
5,29-Jul-18,We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn‚Äôt buy two since we got it on Prime day!,1
5,26-Jul-18,"better sound than my echo dot. Simple to set up, less than 5 minutes.",1
5,29-Jul-18,Great product. I have two and may want to buy a third!,1
5,29-Jul-18,See subject line.  Love it,1
1,21-Jun-18,"Two weeks after setting it up it no longer works.  No connection, no light, no sound.  I guess I shouldn't have purchased a refurbished Dot.",0
5,21-Jun-18,It worked like a brandnew unit! Great addition to my collection.,1
5,30-Jul-18,I loved it does exactly what it says,1
5,30-Jul-18,This is our second Echo Spot - to go with out two Echo Dots - love the look and how Alexia responds.,1
5,07-Jul-18,"So far using it for lights and music. Will connect my tv, vacuum and doorbell soon. Love it!!!!",1
1,31-Jul-18,Item no longer works after just 5 months of use. Will not connect to wifi and unresponsive to reset requests.,0
5,30-Jul-18,Great product.,1
5,28-Jul-18,Fun,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love it,1
5,26-May-18,Works great,1
5,29-Jul-18,I love this device. Makes life easier the more you figure out it can do.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"My kids love Alexa... Skills are amazing, would like to see her get a little smarter answering basic questions",1
5,30-Jul-18,love it as I do all of my echos,1
2,19-Jul-18,The echo works fine but then you get indundated with &#34;Things to try&#34;. I am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things. I found there is no way to turn this off except for .... turning off the screen. If I cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back.,0
3,30-Jul-18,"Part of it is my fault, I thought it could be wireless.  Though for the price, I still feel like it should be. Also the sound quality and volume could be better. I prefer the tap. Unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones, computers or iPads. Just not worth it.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Does what I expected, and more.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Yet another Exho for our home and love them all!!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Third echo dot purchased. Love the product.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"We are still testing this one out and so far, we like it. I was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first. Unfortunately, it sometimes gets our WiFi light bulbs mixed up and won't turn them on but we've been able to manage and fix it. I mean, it's convenient, especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the Dot. I do like that it plays music and has reminders, alarms, etc - I'm just still getting used to the fact that The Man is always listening now.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Awesome piece of technology that has simplified my life. Great purchase.,1
5,06-Jul-18,I like that it‚Äôs voice activated but it don‚Äôt link with any other Bluetooth devices only Alexa devices,1
5,30-Jul-18,need a few more,1
5,26-Jul-18,Works as advertised! It says Alexa is always learning. That's great because I am just learning all the things Alexa can do.,1
3,29-Jul-18,"The ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by Google search has spoiled me.I had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the Echo.Not so, the ability of Alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package.Perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates.",1
4,28-Jul-18,Music mainly but still checking other features,1
5,18-Jul-18,"Given as a gift to my wife, to compliment my echo.  She loves it.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Easy setup, works flawlessly!",1
5,29-Jul-18, ,1
5,28-Jul-18,Worked as promised.,1
5,31-Jul-18,beyond awesome,1
4,29-Jul-18,"The Echo is an amazing device.  Many times it seems very intuitive.  But at other times I ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result.  Installation was fairly straightforward, but I messed up several times simply because I thought a step was complete when it wasn't.  This actually made me lose ground until I figured that out.  My advice is to be patient; the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step.My biggest issue of the moment is that we have several Echo devices in our home and I would like to use them as intercoms (which I am told can be done).  However, I can't make any of the Echos aware of the others existence.  When I ask Alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name.  I know this is likely my fault, but I would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions.  A small deal for many device savvy people, but a challenge for me.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Easy to install. Up and running in minutes.,1
5,30-Jul-18,I definitely like this product.  Wanted to be able to watch Netflix on my tv!  Easy to install!,1
4,30-Jul-18,very nice-needs some work,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love the Echo Dot. So easy. So fun. I get to drop in on my Grandaughter who lives about 2000 miles away. Sounds like she is right next to me.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Perfect,1
5,25-Jul-18,Great product!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Good,1
4,26-Jun-18,Love my two echo dots but the third one we ordered to give as a gift had a defective speaker.  The return process still isn't done and has already taken weeks.,1
5,30-Jul-18,3rd Dot. Love it!,1
4,30-Jul-18,"I've only got to use it for a couple of weeks before having to go into the hospital, but had good time with it for the short time I did use it. It was fun trying to use Alexa",1
4,25-Jun-18,Was a little hard to get it to pare up with the others but once it did no problems at all,1
5,30-Jul-18,Easy to set up Ready to use in minutes.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Absolutely love!!,1
5,29-Jul-18,Love this!  Have it in the kitchen and works well!,1
4,28-Jul-18,I love the size of the echo spot. It fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show. I like going to sleep with the lightening storm. The images along with the sounds are very relaxing. The calling and messaging feature is great. It‚Äôs small enough to take with when we travel. I love and own most of the Alexa products. Our whole family uses them.,1
5,27-May-18,Working great and my daughter loves it!,1
5,29-Jul-18,Works absolutely great,1
5,28-Jul-18,We talk to her all the time for songs and just because we can . There aren‚Äôt dislikes about this device.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Loved it. No more cable bills for us.  I would advise anyone to get one. 2nd one bought.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Sound quality is great. Still learning about all the different things I can do with it. FUN!!!,1
1,29-Jun-18,"Got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates.It‚Äôs far from being useful.Half the time when you ‚Äúwake‚Äù the device to ask a question or initiate a command, it doesn‚Äôt hear what you say and turns off. Basically ignoring you. Often she is unable to answer basic questions.It‚Äôs been so frustrating. Alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier.I would return it but I‚Äôm past the return period...... zzzz",0
5,30-Jul-18,"We've owned a number of Echo devices, but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool.  Other than playing music through a sound system, we haven't found much use for them.  We just don't find the voice user interface to be all that efficient.  The Echo Spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you're routinely interested in.  Furthermore, you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings.  We now use these as bedside clocks.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"My Android would not allow Alexa to connect. Fortunately, my sister was here with her Apple cell. After an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. We are up and running.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Love Alexa. Love the Echo Dot but we have trouble with the speakers when using the intercom.,1
5,21-Jul-18,Easy to install,1
5,16-Jul-18,Works perfect. Save a few bucks and buy the refurbished. Looks brand new.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Already had a firestick in our livingroom, great entertainment, had to get one for the bedroom.",1
5,30-Jul-18,I love it.,1
5,31-Jul-18,Echos are great I have a few of them through out our home .  All in voice range to ask a question. Say a command to turn lights on or off. Or my favorite is play music all though the house.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Amazing device,1
5,30-Jul-18,Easy set up,1
5,30-Jul-18,Fun To interact with,1
3,30-Jul-18,"Still need more AI built into it to interact better. It needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding / answer needs to be right. You can't keep stop Alexa and ask again and again. Also, it should be able to access the wikipedia, dictionary in many areas with better and fast access.Needs to hear us better. Also, we should be able to name it on our own instead calling Alexa or Echo. Price can be reduced a bit (value based) and updates should be auto and daily to improve it.  Connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as well.Good product with good sound quality, but needs more AI built in.",1
5,31-Jul-18,I think this is the 5th one I've purchased. I'm working on getting one in every room of my house. I really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all Echos and controlling the lights throughout my house.,1
2,30-Jul-18,The only negative we have on this product is the terrible sound quality.  A massive difference from the Alexa.  Which to us was a big reason we wanted to purchase this.Won‚Äôt be buying another until the speaker and sound quality can improve.,0
4,30-Jul-18,"Great addition to the Alexa family, just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds. Don't get me wrong I don't regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of $100 off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking.",1
5,29-Jul-18,Love it,1
5,13-Jul-18,Iove it I bought it for my son because he wanted it and it‚Äôs awesome,1
5,29-Jul-18,I have not had it very long. It's my first Alexa thing. I sure like what I have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with,1
5,30-Jul-18,Everyone should have an Echo or two or three or more. I bought my Echo through QVC.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Very convenient,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I love it, I can plan any gender of music from big band to jazz, not easy to find on local radio. Sound is good and I can stop it with a voice command if I get a phone call.",1
5,29-Jul-18,As described and received on time.  Do not like automatic enrolment into music.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Great for checking in on my son after school when I'm still at work.  Love getting the weather and traffic in the morning so I can plan my route accordingly,1
5,29-Jul-18,We love our Echo! We were totally amazed at the speaker quality. Only bummed we didn‚Äôt buy two since we got it on Prime day!,1
5,29-Jul-18,"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!",1
5,30-Jul-18,Have had for just one week so far and I can say it is a blast to have.,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love my new Echo Spot!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it - am using it strictly for music now and it's great!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Used to have fun with. Great to play music, turn on lights and who know what else.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Love it! I personally prefer Spotify music, so it‚Äôs great that I was able to set that as default. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by without music in our home. Also, the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave, so we tell Alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders. He‚Äôs a lot more calmer and doesn‚Äôt bark when we lock the door and start walking away. It‚Äôs a must have!",1
4,29-Jul-18,Great product I just wish it had some sort of equalizer... The bass is a little much,1
5,30-Jul-18,Very pleased,1
2,28-Jul-18,Meh,0
5,30-Jul-18,Nice,1
3,30-Jul-18,It works OK. This speaker quality is not much better than my iPhone X. I would spend the extra money to get the full-size echo which has great sound quality.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Too soon, I'm still learning what I can do with it.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Just got my third one. Love them,1
4,27-Jul-18,"Wish it would have came with the lightbulb, but otherwise works great, fast delivery, and I enjoy using it!",1
5,30-Jul-18,"LOVE, LOVE this new little gadget.  Has  made our lives so much easier.  it's like having our own personal secretary living here in the home.  We hardly need our CD's anymore, since ALEXA plays everything we need.  Going to get the Alexa DOTS soon for more rooms.  Thanks!!",1
2,30-Jul-18,I don‚Äôt like that it goes into sleep mode after 20-30 minutes of ‚Äúinactivity‚Äù. I shouldn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù the fire tv to finish watching a show.,0
4,26-Jul-18,"Nice add on to a home.What I don't like are the limitations, for example world soccer. It won't give you much info of sport teams other than American.",1
5,30-Jul-18,It works just like my other Dots.,1
3,29-Jul-18,"Works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for Alexa doesn't work as well as the normal Echo.  Sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me when I try to interrupt her it to give new instructions.  The speaker also isn't as good as the normal Echo.  Screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who's at the front door.  But, it's great for the bedside.",1
1,20-Jul-18,"I only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb.  When I got everything set up, I realized the echo plus hub won‚Äôt allow full functionality of the bulb.  All it does is turn the light on/off and dim.  It will not change colors.  You still have to have a Hue Bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb.  I wish I‚Äôd bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo I already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and I‚Äôll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights.",0
4,30-Jul-18,"Great device, responsive and helpful",1
5,30-Jul-18,"works good, ni issues",1
1,30-Jul-18,This device does not interact with my home filled with Apple devices.  How disappointing!,0
,30-Jul-18,No different than Apple. To play a specific list of music you must have an Amazon of Spotify ‚Äúplus/prime/etc‚Äù account.  So you must pay to play ‚Äúyour‚Äù music.  3 stars for that reason.  Everything else is üëçüèª .,1
5,29-Jul-18,plays great,1
5,27-Jul-18,"Love my spot, it now acts as my new alarm.",1
5,23-Jul-18,Awesome item that I had to buy two!,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love my fire stick thank you so much,1
5,30-Jul-18,"A great product for the price, works well!!",1
4,01-Jul-18,"This is a great tool (toy?), room-filling music, very convenient to use, just fun to have. Why only 4 stars? Supposed to work with Logitech Harmony remote: nope. Supposed to work with Denon AV receivers: nope. This may not be Amazon't fault, but advertised skills should actually work. We also have the Echo Show, and the Ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door.",1
5,28-Jul-18,Love it.,1
4,29-Jul-18,"So far it has worked well. Not always intuitive as to how to link different devices, or ""skills"", but getting the hang of it.",1
5,29-Jul-18,I have the echo but got 2 show. 1 for my Daughter. Absolutely love it. Especially for the video chat.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Nice,1
5,31-Jul-18,Works great and it's so easy to use that my 4 year old can navigate it.,1
4,29-Jul-18,Good,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love it. bought one for my daughter and one for myself,1
5,28-Jul-18,Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Is amazing I have all 3 and I love this,1
5,01-Jul-18,"Works perfectly, Alexa turns on and off my lights, my tv, roomba!",1
5,29-Jul-18,Easy set up very user friendly,1
5,30-Jul-18,Works much easier than our 3 year old one. Better internet resemption,1
5,30-Jul-18,A great investment. Alexa has helped me out and made me laugh.,1
1,30-Jul-18,Waste of money over the echo generation 2.  You don‚Äôt really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on FaceTime or Skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do I have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution.  I have also had problems with this device shutting down and I have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices.  Price difference is just not worth it,0
5,30-Jul-18,Great product. So many features.,1
5,30-Jul-18,The speaker has excellent sound and works perfectly!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"We love our Echo Plus. We like listening to music,the sound is great. All the features are nice! I do wish it was wireless so we could listen to music outside!",1
5,30-Jul-18,"I love the Echo Spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things, but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom!",1
5,29-Jul-18,We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I purchased this for my mother who is having knee problems now, to give her something to do while trying to over come not getting around so fast like she did.She enjoys all the little and big things it can do...Alexa play this song, What time is it and where, and how to cook this and that!",1
1,30-Jul-18,NOT CONNECTED TO MY PHONE PLAYLIST :(,0
5,11-Jul-18,Simple set up.  Music everywhere.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Plenty of options to choose from!,1
4,30-Jul-18,"I like that it's smaller, but it has never understood commands as easily as our first-gen original Echo did.",1
3,26-Jul-18,It was much smaller than I was expecting for the cost.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Great item for knowledge, directions, music,laughter and more",1
2,30-Jul-18,"It's like Siri, in fact, Siri answers more accurately then Alexa.  I don't see a real need for it in my household, though it was a good bargain on prime day deals.",0
5,30-Jul-18, ,1
5,30-Jul-18,Perfect!  Fast shipment and packaging.  Worked as intended.,1
2,30-Jul-18,"I don't like how I cannot load my Hulu account, it is also very slow. I know it is not my Internet connection because I have an Xbox One that works just fine, but my Fire TV Stick takes forever to load anything.",0
5,30-Jul-18,It worked exactly as expected and the speaker has great sound. It is perfect for my classroom!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I‚Äôm really enjoying this product. Love the flash briefing, the timers, the weather reports and more.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"so far, so good, works great.",1
5,22-Jun-18,Like new,1
3,27-May-18,"It works great, but the reason I'm leaving 3 stars is because it wont play unless it plugged in the whole time. Pretty irritating especially when there is no outlet available.",1
5,06-Jun-18,Perfect. Could not tell the difference from a new one.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Super easy to hook up and program. I use the music feature the most but I love how I can set reminders from my phone and my Echo will remind me at the set time. It‚Äôs great for my news updates too!,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Like the little spot,  now our guest room is Alexa enabled.",1
5,19-Jul-18,"I love this little gadget, replaces my old clock basically, love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates, news briefs.  Let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  Yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on Amazon Prime Now during Prime Day and it was delivered same day for $99.",1
1,30-Jul-18,"Stopped working after 2 weeks ,didn't follow commands!? Really fun when it was working?",0
5,30-Jul-18,Use the product for music and it‚Äôs great!,1
5,21-Jun-18,Love it -- the best.  My experience with refurbished devices is excellent.,1
5,29-Jul-18,"I really have enjoyed it.  Changing the Directv channels, plays iHeartRadio and Pandora , adjusts the ac thermostat and turns the living room lights and outside lights.",1
5,30-Jul-18,I love it! I use it for everything. It‚Äôs a part of my daily routine,1
5,11-Jun-18,"Love my Alexa Echo Dot - I have two of them now - one new, one refurbished.  Both work great and it has become my go to for sooo many things.  I love it as an alarm every morning or whenever.  I love it to play music or sounds of the ocean, or nature sounds when I am trying to sleep.  Just love it for so many things.",1
4,30-Jul-18,I like almost everything,1
5,30-Jul-18,Really like it,1
4,30-Jul-18,"Some times Alexa is a little &#34;thick&#34;, but mostly good!",1
5,31-Jul-18,Works great. Bought as a gift for my boyfriend. Easy & fun to use.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Works beautifully, excellent sound.",1
3,22-Jul-18,"Would be 5 stars if you could turn off the &#34;Things to Try&#34; screen!!!  I should have read up on this before buying the Spot.  Amazon, please update to enable us to turn this off!  It is SO extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see &#34;Things to try&#34;.",1
5,29-Jul-18,"We love having this in our kitchen! Very convenient to look up recipes, listen to the news, or watch prime video while I'm cooking",1
4,30-Jul-18,Initially harder to set up called tech wasn‚Äôt that knowledgeable now working great.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I‚Äôm just learning about this product, but what I know I love !",1
5,29-Jul-18,Cool,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it!,1
5,29-Jul-18,But not very loud,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I love being able to control lights, doors and music.",1
4,30-Jul-18,works great but speaker is not the good for music. Will need to get a Bluetooth speaker.,1
2,31-Jul-18,It is much more difficult to use than the Chromecast.,0
5,29-Jul-18,My new BFF!,1
5,28-Jul-18,"Great product, great price on Prime Day.  Thanks Alexa!",1
5,29-Jul-18,Easy to setup. Love all the things she does.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.",1
1,30-Jul-18,I would love this remote if i wasnt spending so much money replacing the batteries. Its upsetting that i spent money on such a great device all for the batteries not to last.,0
2,19-Jul-18,This thing woke me up in the middle of the night saying ‚Äúready for setup‚Äù. It was already setup. Should be a simple thing to check  time before asking. Wife not happy...,0
5,30-Jul-18,so far i am liking it although i am probably not using it to the full capasity,1
5,30-Jul-18,Use the product for music and it‚Äôs great!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"This device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock. I love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room. Its the first nightstand clock I have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep. The screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all.Overall a great addition to my smart home. Its nice to be able to tell Alexa to turn on/off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone. I have a bunch of other Alexa devices, but this was the first one with a screen.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Very satisfied with the product,1
5,28-Jul-18,"This was a replacement. It was really easy to set up. I had to reauthorize my smart items to work with the new hub, but installation was easy and instructions were clear.",1
5,28-Jul-18,"We‚Äôve had the original Echo for quite some time and just recently added the Show.  It was simple to setup and more inviting to use with the visual interface.  The Echo is being used as the primary interface for my connected home system which is currently only controlling lights and switches.  I look forward to expanding on that capability.  We also use it for maintaining lists, as a music player, general information, and entertainment.  I haven‚Äôt used the Show to shuffle through our favorite  photographs but will start that soon.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"It was smaller than I had anticipated, and when I say that I very much mean it. However, it still works very well! Quality sound, easily programmed, easy to work with, but Alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs.",1
5,30-Jul-18,"Very helpful for playing music, setting alarms, and talking to you when you are lonely.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Easy to use and fast setup,1
5,02-Jul-18,"Works great, never had any issues.",1
5,02-Jul-18,outstanding I use all the time....works just like they say,1
5,30-Jul-18,We have so much fun with this!  So easy to use that even my four year old loves talking to Alexa!!,1
5,28-Jul-18,This is very user friendly,1
5,28-Jul-18,I love being able to see information that Alexa gives.  When notifications are turned on it lets you know when your order will be delivered and it also tells you what the order is. You can use the Echo screen to pull up details of your orders. You can use the Alexa skill to make calls from uhyour Echo.,1
5,30-Jul-18,I like the echo show its the best! big screen you can watch movies preview from the movie and alexa will answer all your question you name it.,1
1,25-Jul-18,It worked for a month or so then it stopped. I've tried everything to try and make it work but nothing is working. I want a refund,0
5,30-Jul-18,"Music, weather, time.",1
5,30-Jul-18,I've had previous experience with the echo Dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the water!It's great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud.,1
2,30-Jul-18,Nope. Still a lot to be improved. For most of the things we ask.. It says.. Hmmmm.. I dont know that.,0
5,30-Jul-18,Awesome product,1
5,29-Jul-18,I have been wanting one of these for a while now.  Bought on Prime Day and absolutely love it.,1
4,30-Jul-18,I like it and it‚Äôs helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"Awesome product, very responsive!Alexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music. It uses the Bing search engine instead of google. If only the two could combine. It would be a perfect product.",1
5,29-Jul-18,Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love the echo I purchased it for company for my husband he is 83 and Alexa is great all he has to do is say her name and she tells him a joke and plays his favorite songs,1
2,30-Jul-18,I would not recommend this to anyone. It won't load netflix or if it does on rare occasion it won't run the program all the way thru. It tells you the we are unable to process this title at this time. Try again later.  It is not the Netflix site cause I can stream it just fine on my computer.  Its the Firestick. very disappointing.,0
5,30-Jul-18,"Alarm,bed time story, universal",1
5,30-Jul-18,Awesome device to have in home.  Full of very useful information.  Don't have to us e my phone to answer spur of the moment questions.,1
3,29-Jul-18,"After two weeks I am not sure if I like the ever present Alexa to have a screen as well.  I bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera, and that works.  But the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off - instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video.  There is something about only audio that made Alexa different, no I some ways it is a TV that you can talk to.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Works good for the most part. You ask it some questions and she says she doesn‚Äôt know. I thought she was supposed to know everything,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love how I can take it on vacation and use it. Very easy to set up.,1
4,28-Jul-18,"So far I like it.  I bought it just for some music though, and it sounds pretty good.",1
5,25-May-18,Great product,1
1,21-Jul-18,Disconnects often,0
3,30-Jul-18,"Doesn't know half the things asked. Can't recognize my sprinkler wifi controller, even though product details says it is compatible. Can't program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router. Just a handy music player. That's if you have Amazon Music.",1
5,16-Jun-18,Purchased for my 83 year old mother-she loves talking to Alexa! Very responsive-can detect its ‚Äúname‚Äù from all over the room.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Great addition to our breakfast room kitchen.  Tunes and information instantly available.  Slowly learning more features.,1
5,28-Jul-18,Love it,1
1,22-Jul-18,"I own 3 of these...  amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool.  You can customize the screen contents, but you cannot turn off there advertising, Things to Try...  People will suggest that you can, but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option.Moreover, they should increase the size slightly, and improve the audio speaker.  That would give you a 5 star device.Right now i‚Äôm debating whether to return all 3 devices.  My wife says we should.",0
3,30-Jul-18,Works very well for Amazon and Netflix but will not a let all viewing platforms like VUDU. It also will shut down if HULU is played for more than a couple minutes and yes I have it directly plugged into the wall so low power source is not an issue (even checked outlet voltage) an issue which is typically the answer you get for that issue.over all the quality of the picture is quiet well and is a user friendly platform to use If they would fix those two issues I would have one on every tv in the house but as it sits this will be our only one. to bad to because I relay like amazon products and having Alexa is always nice,1
5,30-Jul-18,"We really love our Echo Dot, we can get questions answered right away and play any music we can think of.",1
5,30-Jul-18,This is my second one. I have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.It is amazing for a quick look up while I am working. I live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.I will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. The gift of organization and information at a voice command away.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Good speaker for bedroom or office,1
5,28-Jul-18,awesome product! I am in the process of having every room in my house set up with automation and The Show is now my favorite device!,1
2,30-Jul-18,"Alexa is pretty dumb ,,,",0
5,30-Jul-18,Easy setup  Love it!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Perfect for a home office,1
5,30-Jul-18,Second one for my house. This is great...I am not tech oriented and all I have to do is hold down a button and talk. Now I am watching tv too much! LOL!,1
4,30-Jul-18,We love the Show.  It loses the connection every now and then but not sure if that is an Show issue or our internet issue.  But overall we use it for many applications.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Up dated news,1
5,27-Jul-18,Love it!,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love all that you can do with the Echo Spot!,1
5,08-Jul-18,Started here with Amazon productsAnd I regret nothing is been absolutely great journey and my products continue to improve my day-to-day life,1
3,30-Jul-18,The speaker could be better...,1
5,29-Jul-18,Our family really loves this new Echo,1
2,30-Jul-18,Very disappointed.  Alexa doesn‚Äôt hear me and doesn‚Äôt respond to my requests.,0
5,30-Jul-18,Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom,1
4,30-Jul-18,The outlet does not work with it. Was disappointed in that.,1
5,03-Jul-18,Easy set up,1
5,30-Jul-18,Clear music,1
4,30-Jul-18,Haven't used it enough,1
5,30-Jul-18,so far love it working on getting more things set up love the grocery list app,1
5,29-Jul-18,Mainly use it for the music but I‚Äôm learning more all the time.  Really nothing bad to say about it,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love this item and being able to hear any kind of music.  I enjoyed it so much that I ordered another.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Enjoyed entire echo experience,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it!! Super fun! Easy to use! My three year old even gets involved,1
5,31-Jul-18,Very easy to install. Voice control is great.,1
3,28-Jul-18,It doesn‚Äôt play you tube videos,1
5,30-Jul-18,The sound is amazing and many collections of all music,1
5,30-Jul-18,Good sound works well,1
4,30-Jul-18,"This is great for music, video calling, kitchen timers, and probably a bunch more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever-floating ""things to try"" on the home screen. This is purely an aesthetic complaint, but hopefully soon Amazon allows the option to shut it off.",1
5,29-Jul-18,"I love my Echo show!  and now i have this in my bedroom and it's wonderful!, music, info, sleeping sounds!",1
5,28-Jul-18,Wonderful product.  Love alexia,1
5,30-Jul-18,New to Alexa. Like this spot a lot.,1
5,23-Jul-18,Husband loves it!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Love being able to see, as well as hear things.  Sound is better, too!",1
4,31-Jul-18,I like how it will connect to bluetooth without an adapter like the Google. Only reason for 4 stars is volume level without external speaker. Easy to use.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Easy to setup.  Sometimes Alexis does not work the greatest. The connection fire stick and WiFi is way bettter than Netflix .,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Works great, love the fact you can play the same music on a group of devices.",1
5,30-Jul-18,i do wish the dot could connect to the fire stick but both products still worked flawlessly,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Just like it's big sister, the Echo, only smaller, with slightly less audio fidelity, but much lower price (on amazon prime day:-)Used in another room to add Alexa to an additional room.",1
5,30-Jul-18,awesome.understands my kids,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Works exactly how you would expect, right out of the box. I love being able to not only hear, but now see, what I need on this device. I loved my regular echo, but the Show is just so much better!  It works wonderfully for music (especially paired with the Amazon music account) and is perfect with my ring doorbell. Love it!",1
5,30-Jul-18,"daughter wanted a white boombox, nothing good out for 11 yr old.  decided to go echo dot for most any request + white BT good speaker.  she loved the gift and nice option for many things on the internet.",1
5,02-Jul-18,Love it!,1
5,30-Jul-18,Easy to set up,1
1,29-Jul-18,Returned from repair with No repair done. It has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself.I sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed.  The site gives no option to complain from the page.I have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position.,0
5,30-Jul-18,This is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better. Thank you!,1
4,30-Jul-18,I really love my dots! So awesome how it‚Äôs connects all my rooms. But like you‚Äôve read with other reviews they are definitely lower in volume. Which I‚Äôm sure if I connected it to speaker or another device it would be great. But as a stand alone the volume is just ok. Definitely not like my tall echo. And the dots don‚Äôt pick up voice as good as my tall echo.Still totally love them and would recommend 100%,1
5,02-Jul-18,Very happy,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Not perfect but very good! A few times Alexa picked up something from TV, and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things. If you call something &#34;light&#34; in the app you need to say light, not &#34;lights.&#34; Echo Plus has no problems as a smart hub but I could use better user directions. Well worth owning and a good step to making my home Smart!",1
4,20-May-18,"Works well, but the speaker is not so grand. Getting another speaker to drop this into. In the future I would have just gone with the full size echo.",1
3,28-Jul-18,I like the list ability and the music I can play.  I do not like that I can not create a playlist without using the app and even then Alexa will not play my songs I have to do it through my tablet or phone.  I also do not like that Alex can not print again it has to be done through the app.,1
1,30-Jul-18,It don‚Äôt show nothing,0
5,29-Jul-18,bought for my wife she loves it,1
5,29-Jul-18,Very responsive. Great sound quality for its size.,1
4,27-Jul-18,Works well and was easy to set up.,1
5,29-Jul-18,I received the echo in perfect condition. The device was easy to set up and responds quickly and without any issues. Alexa is a great addition to our family!,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Great fun getting to know all the functions of this product.  WOW -- family fun and homework help.  Talking with other grandchildren,who also have an Echo, is a HUGE bonus.  Can't wait to learn more and more and more",1
5,29-Jul-18,We got this as a wedding gift and haven‚Äôt discovered all of its features yet. Will update. Playing music is great though!,1

5,30-Jul-18,"Love it!! It is so handy and easy to use. Got it for my classroom, but I many need to just get another one.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Have the echo wanted something smaller in another room  they work together great,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I love this device! All the functionality of an Amazon Echo with the added benefit of a video screen. It looks great on my nightstand as a clock (lots of faces to choose from) and displays weather, reminders, etc. I think it can do video calls too but I use FaceTime for that anyway. It‚Äôs a great shape and doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of room. I‚Äôm planning to get another one for my guest room. Awesome for a great price!",1
5,29-Jul-18,"I already have an Alexa and with Amazon find today I could not resist getting an echo also. It is the best thing I ever did, I use them on each side of the house! And couldn't be happier!",1
4,30-Jul-18,Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.,1
4,28-Jul-18,Sound very nice perfect for the price,1
5,29-Jul-18,Works as advertised,1
2,24-Jul-18,Doesn't use apple music.  It is worthless to me without it.  Sound quality on it is also poor.,0
5,30-Jul-18,"Makes turning on and off things in the house so simple. Great for little updates as well, like checking the weather and such.",1
1,30-Jul-18,Garbage...Even trying to watch Amazon Prime Video this piece of garbage looses internet connection half way thru a show. The cheapest Roku works 100 time better. DO not waste your time or money on this piece of garbage.,0
4,30-Jul-18,Works great sounds great does not miss a beat wish it had a battery for better portability,1
4,30-Jul-18,I just this for listening to talk radio in the morning and turning lights on and off etc. The system does an excellent job as a full house sound system streaming Sirius.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"I like being able to tell Alexia the music I want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if I am not very specific about the title.",1
5,30-Jul-18,This thing is great if you have internet and amazon prime.,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Works great, video call function nice when communicating through drop-in",1
5,28-Jul-18,"Easy setup using the app, which was also easy to install on my phone.  The sound quality while for listening to music on Pandora is wonderful!!",1
5,28-Jul-18,Almost as good as my Bose. Love the whole house music.,1
5,28-Jul-18,"More than I expected. I use it for timers, alarms, shopping lists, calendar events, news, weather, and so much more.",1
5,23-Jul-18, ,1
5,30-Jul-18,The sound from this Echo 2nd Generation is phenomenal!  Not to mention that I just love Alexa!  She is very helpful.,1
5,28-Jul-18,"Love to have meditation music, I use it as a morning alarm, just to mention few in general I love it",1
4,24-May-18,Overall it works very well. Some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!,1
5,27-Jun-18,You could not tell this was refurbished. Works Excellent. I would highly recommended instead of purchasing new.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"It‚Äôs still a great product.But the sound quality does seem worse.Don‚Äôt get me wrong. You definitely get used to it within an hour. But it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better.Besides that , it‚Äôs great.With the addition of being able to play Just over Bluetooth with no WiFi, it‚Äôs even better.",1
5,30-Jul-18,Easy to set up and start using.. works as advertised.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Bluetooth sound is great. Videos are crazy. It‚Äôs an amazing device.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Easy to use!,1
4,30-Jul-18,"I like to use it for listening to podcasts.  I like to set up the greeting in the morning to tell me what's new.  The one thing I don't like was getting it to recognize the radio station I wanted to listen to.  I finally got it working, but had to work through the bugs.",1
1,14-Jun-18,cant seem to get this thing to sink with my wireless not sure If I will be returning it will try one more time.,0
5,28-Jul-18,We like the video calling feature. We got this so we can be in contact with our elderly parents and it works well,1
5,30-Jul-18,The echo works well. I was able to sync it with my other Amazon music devices.,1
4,30-Jul-18,My son loves his Echo Dot.,1
1,30-Jul-18,"My old amazon fire stick kept crashing when using Sling TV.I bought this one thinking the old one was defective.This one is doing the same thing. When going back into Sling, it starts up where I left off in the program.",0
5,30-Jul-18,Love my Echo. Still learning how every thing works but having tons of fun.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Still learning it,1
5,30-Jul-18,I love how compact it is.,1
5,30-Jul-18,It's fun to use... I love novelty gadgets... And Alexa really works well for me...,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it. Added it to an upstairs bedroom,1
4,03-Jul-18,"Was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review. The one challenge with the hub is that Phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub. Basic functionality works with this unit, but now I need two apps to set everything how I want it instead of one, which has caused some user issues. It's woken up a couple times without the trigger word, which I find highly unsettling. We have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly, but it's usually just one or two repeats if that happens.The speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen/living room. The sleek design is not obtrusive. My girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we've had entertaining conversations with it.",1
4,30-Jul-18,"Tons of features and skills, and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music. You still need some work on the AI, in responding to random questions though. My Android phone is far better at those... with the Echo I still get a lot of &#34;hmm, I'm not sure&#34; or &#34;I don't have an opinion on that.&#34;",1
5,30-Jul-18,I'm addicted to this thing.,1
5,29-Jul-18,Great product,1
5,29-Jul-18,Funny how you buy something just because it looks fun and it winds up being a totally useful part of your home!!!  Loving it!!,1
2,30-Jul-18,Sad joke. Worthless.,0
5,29-Jul-18,I having it in my living room. Music sounds really good in my living room . I can hear it upstairs.,1
5,30-Jul-18,I really like the echo dot. It‚Äôs amazing to be able to set an alarm or timer just by talking to the echo dot.,1
5,30-Jul-18,I am in love with alexa,1
5,31-May-18,The voice clarity has made my eavesdropping efforts so much easier - the government. :),1
5,28-Jul-18,Great sound for the size and the prize!! And of course....Alexa!,1
5,29-Jul-18,I love it!!,1
4,22-Jul-18,I love it but does not play well with my Amazon Prime... many shortcomings and potential fees,1
5,30-Jul-18,Powerful little stick,1
5,25-May-18,WORKS GREAT,1
5,19-Jul-18,"Got one for me and for my son on Prime Day. We love them! I want one in every room, but that would be excessive.",1
5,28-Jul-18,I like the volume up and down on the top so I can turn it down quickly.,1
5,29-Jul-18,We're thoroughly enjoying our Amazon Echo. Installation was easy using the Alexa app. I purchased 2 Kasa smart plugs to control our living room lights. Installation again was easy using the Kasa app. They sinqued right up with the Echo. We're enjoying playing music with the Echo and the sound quality is awesome. We've added a Kasa smart bulb for our kitchen. Setup was seamless. We're looking forward to adding more automation to our home.,1
5,30-Jul-18,Love it.  It works great.  Alexa still has some problems  but it is getting better every day.  I'm not an expert but I think the sound quality is fine.  Not perfect but good.,1
4,30-Jul-18,Enjoying it and still learning all the commands.  Ran into one frustrating issue.  It was not user friendly when trying to set up voice recognition for a household.,1
3,29-Jul-18,Eh it‚Äôs cool and all but also kinda boring I don‚Äôt really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3/5 is about right. I can‚Äôt connect to my Spotify unless it‚Äôs premium and I‚Äôm in college and I‚Äôm not paying or that or amazon music so,1
5,29-Jul-18,"Doesn't work with my fairly new smart TV, but that's mainly the TV manufacturers(LG) fault due to not supporting anything older than TVs from this year. My smart locks also need an additional piece of equipment in order to connect as well. Speakers sound great and works very well.",1
5,26-Jul-18,Love all the cool thing I can do!,1
5,30-May-18,Great little thing. Works better than siri.,1
5,30-Jul-18,"Cool little piece of tech...we‚Äôre still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but I can see some potential.  Even my ‚Äòtechnically challenged‚Äô wife already figured out how to video call our daughter.",1
5,05-Jul-18,Great,1
5,01-Jun-18,I loved it it works great,1

3,28-Jul-18,I was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement .  The display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task.The display works well for camera viewing.It is an attractive device. and a decent value at $99,1
5,28-Jul-18,Great size for bedside. Plus it dims at night!!,1
5,30-Jul-18,I have a friend now.,1
5,28-Jul-18,This is my second Show.  I like them very much.  I use mine for music and my Arlo security cameras.  I can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice. They are exceptionally capable devices.  I highly recommend them.,1
5,30-Jul-18,The Echo is wonderful but I'm still learning how to use it. Music requests are somewhat limited.,1
5,30-Jul-18,this is so much fun to play with - I just ask to set an alarm to wake in the morning and when it goes off I tell Alexa to turn it of - Alexa learns from the questions I ask. SHe will play music that you ask her to play if its the amazon music domain. If I wake up in the middle of the night I do not have to turn on a light I just ask alexa what time is it. When I want the current weather she tells me. Ask her what going on in the city she knows. Call a friend she will dial ( I haven't used that one yet but she said she could if its in y contacts.,1
3,14-Jun-18,"I love Alexa, but the sound on the dot is not the best. I own an echo 2nd gen for the kitchen/living room and got this for my bedroom, but there‚Äôs a SIGNIFICANT difference in sound. The dot lacks a full base sound and sounds as if it‚Äôs coming off a cheap portable speaker. I was REALLY disappointed. I returned it right away and just shelled out the money to buy a second echo 2 for my bedroom also.",1
5,24-Jul-18,"well what can you say,  Love It  Love It  Love It  enough said",1
5,30-Jul-18,Works like a charm. Fast delivery and no problems.,1
4,30-Jul-18,"I love this little Spot more than I thought I would. The sound is great for such a little thing...my music plays nice and loud and clear. The video is terrific...I was watching some Prime shows just for the heck of it, and I was really impressed. Immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday!Only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars...I really wish it was cordless. I love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain. And it won‚Äôt connect to my Bluetooth speaker while playing Amazon Prime Music for some reason, which is a drag when I want to hear it in the dining room during dinner. Of course, if it was CORDLESS I could just bring it with me...otherwise, I absolutely love it and will probably buy another one!",1
5,29-Jul-18,"Bought this a few weeks ago -  everything about this product is excellent !!!!! Don't forget to buy a charger when ordering, it's a must have to take outside by the pool and not have to worry about hiring an electrician to put in outlets all over the yard.",1
4,30-Jul-18,Small speaker tin sound. Great with good Bluetooth speaker.,1
5,30-Jul-18,works like any other one!,1
