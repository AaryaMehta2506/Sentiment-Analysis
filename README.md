# Sentiment-Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis system that classifies text reviews as positive or negative. Built using Python, Flask, Keras, and deployed in Jupyter Notebook, it processes user inputs and provides real-time sentiment predictions.

Project Description
This project aims to analyze customer reviews and classify them into positive or negative sentiments using machine learning techniques. The application is powered by a Flask-based web app, and the model is built using Keras for deep learning. The project takes advantage of Jupyter Notebooks for development and testing, making it easy to visualize the modelâ€™s performance and results.

Features
Sentiment Classification: The application classifies text reviews as either "Positive" or "Negative."
User Interface: A simple web interface built with Flask allows users to input reviews and receive sentiment predictions in real-time.
Deep Learning Model: A Keras-based model trained on labeled review data to predict sentiment.
Visualization: Insights and performance metrics of the model can be visualized in Jupyter Notebook.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used to implement the project.
Flask: Web framework for creating the user interface.
Keras: Deep learning library used to build the sentiment classification model.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for development, testing, and visualization.
Pandas & Numpy: Data manipulation libraries.
TensorFlow: Backend for Keras to run the deep learning model.

Usage
Enter a review text in the input box.
Click on the "Analyze" button to get the sentiment prediction (Positive/Negative).
The result will be displayed below the input box.
Dataset
The model is trained using a dataset of labeled reviews (positive and negative). You can find the dataset file in the data/ folder of this repository.
